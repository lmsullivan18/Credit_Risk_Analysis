# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to apply machine learning to the real-world challenge of credit risk. I used different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Using the analysis of the different techniques, I can make a recommendation as to which model should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results
### Oversampling
- In the first section we compared Naive Random Oversampling with SMOTE Oversampling.
